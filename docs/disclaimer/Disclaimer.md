# Name & Trademark Disclaimer

*Last updated: June 29, 2025*

This project was previously known as **MITPA (MIT Preparation Academy)**. To avoid any legal issues or conflicts related to the unauthorized use of the **MIT** (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) registered trademark, the official name of the project has now been changed to **PRACTA** — **Preparation Academy for College & Tech Admissions**.

This **Disclaimer** is published to inform all users, contributors, and community members that **MITPA** has **no official affiliation with MIT**, and the former name has been replaced by **PRACTA** to ensure full transparency and to prevent any trademark or copyright infringement.

## Why This Matters

The acronym **MIT** is a globally recognized registered trademark. Keeping any outdated reference to the old name may create confusion or legal complications. Our goal is to operate ethically, transparently, and in compliance with intellectual property laws and best practices.

## What You Should Do

If you find the old name **MITPA** still appearing anywhere — such as:

* Discord servers
* Websites or subdomains
* Documents, slides, PDFs
* GitHub repositories
* Images, logos, or any other files

… or in any other project-related material, **please let us know immediately** so we can correct and update it as quickly as possible.

## How to Report It

Please send an email to **[legal@practa.tech](mailto:legal@practa.tech)** or open a support ticket in the official Discord community server.

## Our Commitment

This disclaimer is part of our commitment to keep the community **legally safe**, **open**, and **free from trademark conflicts** — so that PRACTA can continue to grow independently, ethically, and fully focused on its mission to support students.

Thank you for helping us keep PRACTA transparent and compliant!
